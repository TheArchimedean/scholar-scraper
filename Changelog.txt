v1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UI
- Added a title, version number and brief description to console output.
- Added a counter next to search statement output to show progress through
  the query file.
- Refined console print statemenets to provide more relevant information.
- Enforced a standardised width to console elements.
- All queries that encountered an error are logged and reported at the end.

Output
- If the "Individual sheets" folder does not exist, it is created.
- Filenames now contain the date, to somewhat prevent accidental overwrites
  (so long as the program is not run multiple times in one day).

Logic
- The larger csv with all information is now updated with each iteration of 
  the loop through all queries, to ensure it outputs at least some data even
  if the program crashes.
- Added a checker incase a paper contains no date information at all, which
  in this case will now return 0 instead of 'na/na/1/1'.
- Blank lines in the "search queries.txt" file are now ignored by the program.
- Papers are now sorted by year (per academic) instead of by citation count.

Other
- README.txt now contains the correct code to run "requirements.txt" with pip.
- Requirements.txt now contains strict version informaiton on each package to
  ensure smooth operation.

v1.1.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a Try/Except to catch errors when an academic has no affiliation listed
  on Google Scholar.
